# Dos and Don'ts (misc)

## Dos

* keep all the things up-to-date, including apps
* [read the blablabla](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211148) but cover the camera anyway, as there are very cheap and relatively thin products on the market for that
* make regular backups on external devices or the cloud
* encrypt the disk with [FileVault](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204837)
* disable bluetooth & airdrop when you don't need them
* don't commit `.DS_STORE` files (use a `.gitignore` for that)
* install apps from trusted sources only

## Don'ts

* don't dual boot, as it would require disabling built-in security mechanisms for very little convenience
* while [AsahiLinux](https://github.com/AsahiLinux/AsahiLinux.github.io) looks pretty cool, I would not recommend it in a security perspective [^1]
* don't auto-connect to known WiFi SSIDs
* don't put too much money on 16Go and other extra options, the base MacBook Air M1/8Go is very competitive for most usages, including dev & hacking
* don't give admin permissions to users when it's not needed (least privilege, always)
* don't disable security mechanisms for convenience or to install untrusted apps
* don't use CleanMyMac and similar third-party apps: these softs are very aggressive and destructive

[^1]: even the installer triggers multiple warnings and tell users installation will be done at their own risks
